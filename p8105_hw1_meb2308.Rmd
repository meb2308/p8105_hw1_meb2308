HW 1 Solutions 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

```


## Problem 1

Create a data frame with the elements specified in problem 1: a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution, a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0, a character vector of length 10, and a factor vector of length 10 with 3 lactor levels.

```{r}
prob1_df = 
  tibble(
    samp = rnorm(10),
    samp_gt_0 = samp > 0,
    factor_vec = factor(c("low", "low", "low", "mod", "mod", "mod", "mod", "high", "high", "high"))
)

```

Take the mean of each variable in the data frame.

```{r}
mean(pull(prob1_df, samp))
mean(pull(prob1_df, samp_gt_0))
mean(pull(prob1_df, char_vec))
mean(pull(prob1_df, factor_vec))
```

We can take the mean of numbers and logical vectors, but not character or factor vectors.
